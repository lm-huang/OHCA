## Story

The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) collects, stores and shares EMS data from across the U.S. The NEMSIS dataset will help many organizations assess EMS needs and performance, and support better strategic planning for the EMS systems of tomorrow. Data also helps benchmark performance, determine the effectiveness of clinical interventions, and facilitate cost-benefit analyses. The goal in this project is to help Dr. May -- a critical care physician at Maine Health -- investigate strategies for improving outcomes when cardiac-arrest victims receive care from first responders. For example, there's evidence of disparities in rural and urban scenarios. It's unclear if this is happening in Maine.

However,  a notable concern was the disparity in the administration of epinephrine, where only 20% of patients received it, as opposed to the expected 90% based on real-world practices. This discrepancy raised questions about the dataset's reflection of real-world scenarios and the potential factors influencing these outcomes, especially in rural versus urban settings.

Responding to stakeholder feedback and initial findings, the project's approach has evolved. We now focus on a more detailed analysis, considering a wider range of factors that influence the effectiveness of rescue efforts for cardiac arrest (AC) patients. These factors include the patient's physical condition, the nature and progression of their condition, the timing and methods of rescue, and the overarching impact of urbanicity on these elements. This refined strategy aims to categorize the aforementioned factors based on urbanicity levels to assess the influence on rescue effectiveness and, if possible, to improve rural rescue efforts or challenge the perceived correlation between urbanicity and rescue outcomes.

By expanding the scope of analysis and incorporating a comprehensive assessment of rescue effectiveness, the project aspires to provide a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities within EMS systems.

## Approach

We assume that the effectiveness of rescue efforts for AC patients is related to factors such as the patients' physical condition, etiology and condition of the disease, rescue time, and methods employed. The effectiveness of the rescue should be evaluated in conjunction with the patient's condition, survival rate, and prognosis. We attempt to categorize all of the above factors based on urbanicity to understand the impact of urbanicity on these factors, thereby proposing suggestions to improve the effectiveness of rural rescue efforts or to refute the claim that there is a correlation between rescue effectiveness and different levels of urbanicity. In comparison to previous studies, we conduct a more thorough analysis of the causes leading to AC, and we broaden the assessment dimensions of rescue effectiveness in hopes of achieving a more granular and comprehensive study of this issue.

 The risk of the study lies in the question of the validity of the data sources. We will attempt to screen and analyze the reasons for the significantly low rate of adrenaline usage in the dataset in order to confirm the rescue methods within the dataset.
